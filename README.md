# Physics-Simulation
Final Year Advanced Graphics: Using OpenGL to render primitive objects and make a simulation to compare spatial hashing and pairwise collision algorithms.

In this simulation, you can fire two spheres of different weights. fire a small sphere using the (spacebar) and a heavier larger sphere by pressing the (H) key.

You may also alter the coffiecent of friction and restitution (by default set to 1)

Press the (I) key to lower the friction and the (U) Key to increase the friction by 0.1.

Press the (P) key to lower the restitution and the (O) key to increase the restitution by 0.1.

By default, collsions are detected using a spatial hashing algorithm. Press the (C) key to switch to a Pair Managment algorithm.
